A student companion app is coming after the API is finalized. This app will hopefully be compatible with Android, iOS, Windows Phone/Windows, and Mac OS X.

Email me for the url to use.

Compiling it should be fairly easy. Need help? Come to the library Thursday after school and I'll try to help.

Android version coming soon.
